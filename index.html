            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>

            So, I find myself out of work due to choosing to work for
            a company that was pathetically exposed to the effects of
            a pandemic. That company is no more and took a chunk my
            hard-earned change with it (and I wasn't the worst hit).

            </p>
            <p>

            That was back in June, 2021. Since then, I've been idly
            looking for work. The final year of Antenna was actually
            incredibly stressful so it has been nice to not work for a
            while, but six months is enough. I've been keeping an eye out
            for any interesting opportunites, but have admittedly been
            somewhat half-hearted. There's a second reason for that,
            and it is because I was in Beijing when the pandemic hit -
            my return flights were cancelled and I opted to not fight
            it and just stay in Beijing. It seemed a sensible thing
            to do - initially just to not risk spreading the virus,
            and then not to spread it back again. I didn't imagine
            it would take so long for things to open up again, and
            there's actually not much sign of travel freedom for the
            forseeable, unfortunately.

            </p>
            <p>

            So, here I am, in Beijing.

            </p>
            <p>

            I'm Max. Hello.

            <h2>Why? What's this about?</h2>
            <p>

            While I've been keeping an eye out for new opportunities, I've
            noticed that there's a demand for a 'portfolio'. Previously,
            these were things artists kept, and it has confused me why
            a developer - which I equate with 'programmer', perhaps
            mistakenly - would have such a thing. However, having done
            several interviews, and also dabbled in part-time freelancing
            on Upwork, I've noticed that is seems to be asked for a lot
            and perhaps there's an advantage for a developer to have one.

            </p>
            <p>

            I'm not a designer. I've almost never been responsible for
            the visual appearance of the work I've done - the designs have
            always come from designers. In my view, it's a different job.
            That's not to say that there aren't people who can do both,
            and I know some people who ARE good at both, but they're the
            holy grail, and I'm not that.

            </p>
            <p>

            My preference is for text. I work in the terminal, avoid
            the mouse as much as possible, and for my web work, I prefer
            tables and lists to make basic document structure, and then
            work from there to implement the appearance according to
            the designers' wishes...ideally, they supply the CSS, and
            name the components in their wireframes, which is actually
            the most difficult thing.

            </p>
            <p>

            Indeed, this web page (struggling to not call it a blog for
            some reason) is starting off as basic HTML, and I'll make
            it <em>pretty</em> later on. I wonder how long that will take.

            </p>
            <p>

            So, the purpose of this web page is to introduce myself
            to potential employers, and hopefully answer the question
            they surely want to ask - Am I Any Good?

            </p>
            <p>

            In an attempt to answer that question, I will try to make
            a collection of the work I've done and add some narration
            to give some context and critique so you can tell I know
            when I've done something wrong, or could do better or
            something.

            <h2>I'm mostly OK</h2>

            <p>

            As an executive summary, I consider myself to be 'mostly
            OK'.

            </p>
            <p>

            I'm a useful person to have on a team.

            </p>
            <p>

            I'm more EQ than IQ.

            </p>
            <p>

            I'm not the fastest learner, but I know how to find things
            out - to get things done, and be productive.

            </p>
            <p>

            I'm absolutely terrible in interviews. Usually. I guess
            it depends on the type of interview and how friendly the
            interviewer seems to be.

            </p>
            <p>

            I suffer somewhat from 'imposter syndrome'. Well, I think
            I do, but how can one really know. Perhaps I'm actually not
            as good as I think I am, even though I don't think I'm not
            especially great. Is 'imposter syndrome' only for people
            who are, in reality, actually great? Shrug.

            </p>
            <p>

            I know quite a few people who I think ARE great, and they seem
            to have positive things to say about me. Usually. The ones
            I've worked with anyway. I've collected positive comments
            from my peers and such like, so you can tell for yourself,
            but those are people who have positive things to say - is
            that some sort of confirmation bias? Hrm. I often wonder
            if I should actually get references from people I think
            would give me a not-so-rosy 'report'. I'm pretty sure that
            potential employers would prefer that. It's akin to "What
            are you worst faults?" question that is occasionally asked.

            </p>
            <p>

            I don't know anyone who thinks <em>I</em> am
            <em>great</em>. Well, I can't think of anyone anyway. Maybe
            someone reading this who knows me can disgree...feel
            free...I'm waiting. Is that crickets?  ...lol, wishful
            thinking! :)

              <h3>Zephyr animation</h3>

              <p>

              I did this while I was at Intel in October 2015. I was
              supplied with a promotional video and asked to make
              it into an animation. It was a challenge. I made time
              markets using css custom properties (aka variables),
              which weren't shipped on any browser at the time
              (iirc) which meant I needed to use a preprocessor
              to turn it into valid CSS. I used a tool called <a
              href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cssnext">cssnext</a>
              via its <em>gulp</em> plugin, gulp-cssnext.

              </p>
              <p>

              I chose cssnext because its purpose is to implement
              upcoming standards. When I learn new things, I like for that
              effort to have as big a longevity as possible. If things
              are likely to become standard then they are also likely to
              last for a very long time. Of course, cssnext has gone now -
              oh, the irony - but it has morphed into a postcss plugin, <a
              href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-cssnext">postcss-cssnext</a>.
              Oh, and I see, <em>that</em> has
              also been deprecated too, in favour of <a
              href="https://github.com/csstools/postcss-preset-env">postcss-preset-env</a>.
              Aaaaand, you guess it, <em>that</em>
              has ...ah, not deprecated, just
              <em>moved</em>...to a plugin subdirectory of <a
              href="https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/plugin-packs/postcss-preset-env">postcss-plugins</a>.

              </p>
              <p>

              Sign, what a journey that was. Still, css custom properties
              are now implemented "<em>everywhere</em>" so this project
              works without any such preprocessor, which kind of proves
              my point! Yay for futureproofing :D

              </p>
              <p>
              It really only shows I can do some CSS animation stuff. It's
              not really all that good technically and I expect it would
              be much more maintainable if I did it with a framework
              or something - greensock is the one that comes to mind, but
              I'm sure there are options. It'd be nice to avoid JavaScript
              if possible.
              It also doesn't scale too well, but that's a function of it
              not really being finished :/

              </p>
              <p>

              Anyway, click to see the <a href="zephyr/index.html">Zephyr demo</a>.
              It's best fullscreen.

              <h3>github-button challenge</h3>

              <p>

              This was an interview 'challenge'. I was provided with an
              existing repository containing a working web component
              written in Google Lit and they asked me to add a custom
              property to allow the background color to be set, and an
              attribute/property to make the button open the provided
              link in a new tab, rather than the current tab (the existing
              functionality).

              </p>
              <p>

              The existing implementation ran without any build tools
              or anything - only <br>'npm install'</br> was needed to
              get Google Lit.

              </p>
              <p>

              The challenge was quite simple, almost to the
              point of trivial if you chose to do the minimal
              implementation. However, they gave two days to complete it,
              so I figured I'd go to town on it.

              </p>

              <h4>Unit Tests/Feature Tests</h4>
              <p>

              I implemented the features using TDD (or, perhaps, more
              accurately, BDD), so I could show that is how I prefer to
              work, and that is what they should expect if they were to
              hire me. I did plenty of unit testing while at Nokia, and
              have used it from time to time when I see a clear need
              during development (eg during the 'content push' project
              at Intel).

              </p>
              <p>

              I'm not really all that interested in tooling - there
              are too many options and there are scaffolds out there
              made by people who are smarter than me and who have
              made smart choices. I chose to use tools from the <a
              href="https://open-wc.org/">@open-wc scaffold</a>.  I took
              the test tools from there, and their initial test sample
              to start from. I wrote the 'requirements' first (the ones
              provided by the company who gave me the 'challenge' were
              too simple), and then went through them, one by one, writing
              a failing test and then writing the implementation so that
              it passed.

              </p>
              <p>

              One complication was mocking the window.location.href
              and window.open() calls, which were responsible for
              the button's action. I ended up making the click emit
              a non-bubbling event and having my test listen for that
              event. I didn't much like having things happen at run time
              that are only for tests, but since it was non-bubbling it
              shouldn't have much effect. I later was told that I should
              be able to use sinon to mock these calls and was given <a
              href="https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/writing-tests/mocking/">a
              reference to how to mock</a>. Perhaps I should follow
              that to learn more about that. I know I did a fair bit of
              mocking when writing unit tests at Nokia.

              </p>

              <h4>Documentation</h4>
              <p>

              The existing documentation was minimal and writting in
              markdown in the README.md file. So, that was easy to update
              with the new API.  Other projects I've worked on (recent
              work for Speechpad) have used 11ty for their documentation,
              which is very flexible, but quite complex imo. Perhaps for
              more complex components, or a whole library of components,
              it makes more sense.
